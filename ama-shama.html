                  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                  <p>Raising children requires from parents a lot of effort and time. This is especially true with preschool children - they grow very fast and also their habits are formed. Providing proper nutrition might be very challenging and stressful for caregivers.</p>
                  <h3>Possible Solution</h3>
                  <p>Ama-Shama - a tool that will help parents of preschool children in feeding properly their children. It will also help with inspiration and reduce time spent in the kitchen.</p>

                  <p>Each of the team members participated in all stages of the design process and influenced the shape of the product. I took care of the "Plan" function and, after usability tests, also the "Compose" function. I was also responsible for coordinating the entire prototype so that the combined scenarios of different team members formed a coherent whole.</p>
                  <h3>My tasks</h3>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>"Plan" function</li>
                    <li>"Compose" function (after usability tests)</li>
                    <li>Coordinating the entire prototype</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Methodology in user testing</h3>
                  <p>We wanted to see where users are doing mistakes and what is incomprehensible to them. It bothered us is the terminology we used clear or maybe users understand otherwise. And above all - we wanted to find out what could be improved so the app will be simply better to use, so we've conducted usability testing through Google meet.</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>10 tests</li>
                    <li>1 hour each</li>
                    <li>7 tasks given to ech user</li>
                    <li>Think aloud protocol</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>During tests we were able to observe several problems with our product. They have been categorized into critical, essential and minor errors. We also noted many interesting observations of the testers - both positive and negative. These insights will enable the introduction of many interesting solutions at a later stage of product development.</p>
                  <p><span class="span-bolder">Critical error</span> - <span class="span-bolder" style="color: var(--background); background-color: red;">red colour</span>
                    <ul class="list">
                      <li>They prevent performance specific tasks.</li>
                      <li>Cause great frustration in users.</li>
                      <li>Require immediate improvement.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p><span class="span-bolder">Essential error</span> - <span class="span-bolder" style="color: var(--background); background-color: blue;">blue colour</span>
                    <ul class="list">
                      <li>Their solution significantly improves the user experience.</li>
                      <li>They can be worked around.</li>
                      <li>They involve unnecessary user activity and / or frustration.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p><span class="span-bolder">Minor error</span> - <span class="span-bolder" style="color: var(--background); background-color: green;">green colour</span>
                    <ul class="list">
                      <li>Most of the users can deal with them.</li>
                      <li>They do not significantly affect the user experience.</li>
                      <li>They do not cause special big emotions.</li>
                      <li>Their improvement accelerates and increases the smooth use of the product.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>We collected all our notes in Miro. Both those concerning errors as well as those containing opinions
                    users and their negative and positive
                    feelings. We grouped the cards that were relevant
                    the same tasks, and then we assigned the tasks
                    importance. We also verified how many users
                    had a problem at the same stage of exploration
                    prototype. Finally, we multiplied the impact of the error (5 - blocker, 3 - significant, 2 - minor, 1 - opinion) by task importance (3 - very important, 2 - important, 1 - less important) by its frequency occurrence. Thanks to this, we received the result or the severity of the error.</p>
                    
                  <p><span class="span-bolder">Impact × Severity × Frequency = Severity of the error</span></p>
                  <p>The severity of the errors helped us determine what to take
                    in the first stage of the prototype corrections. Bearing
                    in view of the entirety carried out so far
                    usability tests - we adopted the severity division
                    according to the following range:<br>
                    0.1-1.9 - low priority,<br>
                    2.0-5.9 - high priority,<br>
                    6.0-9.0 - the highest priority.<br></p>
                    
                  <p>Oops... However, we figured out that to act with low priority we also qualified user reviews, not just errors. We wanted to repeat the whole process, but it turned out that most of the respondents' opinions and suggestions were in the range of 0.1-0.6. Therefore, in the list of errors below, there are minor errors in the range 0.7-1.9. We found some of them worthy of further consideration and amendment at this stage. The changes that we decided to implement were cosmetic, but we believe that they can improve the reception of the entire project.</p>

                    on Ama-Shama from a different perspective and admit,
                    that we made some mistakes at the stage design. However, this pinch of salt did not put us off. On the contrary - it increased the value of the coffee,
                    as it does in practice
                    any other dish. We learned,
                    that it is always worth asking and being open
