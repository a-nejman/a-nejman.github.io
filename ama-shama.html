                  <p>Our client Karina Mucha is a&nbsp;psychologist and academic lecturer. She created various textbooks and agendas for early childhood and preschool education. For popularizing reading among children and teachers, she received the 'Meritorious for Polish Culture' award from the Minister of Culture and National Heritage.</p>
                  <p>Being in the educational environment and knowing this market she decided to create a&nbsp;digital tool helping to gain knowledge in the area of <strong>educational psychology</strong>. This field has seen rapid growth and development as a&nbsp;profession in the last twenty years. There are a&nbsp;lot of materials in English but very few in Polish language.</p>
                  <p>That's where Karina had <strong>seen a&nbsp;void on the market and decided to fill it with a&nbsp;new online product. The biggest question was: How should it look like?</strong> Here our collaboration started. <a href="https://xjkt4a.axshare.com/#id=alba83&p=splashscreen&g=1&dp=0&fn=0">Prototype</a></p>

I was also responsible for coordinating the entire prototype so that the combined scenarios of different team members formed a coherent whole.</p>
                  <h3>Function planning</h3>
                  <p>Critical error <strong>Editing method - too hard to find </strong>- 9/10 users had problem to find editing method, usually they tried to edit a specific meal by clicking on their photo.

                      <li>Recommendation<br>Changing the location of the edit icon, it should be within the photo of a specific meal.</li>

                  <p>Essential error <strong>Wrong interpretation of the “Add a set” button </strong>- 4/10 users interpreted the plus on the screen as a button to add a dish or add own recipe to the list.
                    <ul class="list">
                      <li>Recommendation <br>The button should be editted so that it unambiguously informs which function it activates. For this purpose in addition to the “plus” icon, an appropriate text can be added.</li>

                  <p>Critical error <strong>Misinterpretation of the button “Compose a new recipe” </strong>- 4/10 users misinterpreted the button "+ Compose a new recipe", which resulted in great problems in completing the task. Most often button was interpreted as an option to enter own recipe from scratch.

                  <h3>The team and methodology</h3>
                  <p>Our team consisted of 4 UX Researchers, on each stage of the research we closely collaborated with Karina Mucha and consulted all the deliverables. In the beginning we've formulated research problems:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>What content and in what form should be provided to the users of Educational Psychology portal so that it is interesting for them?</li>
                    <li>When would they be willing to take paid online courses related to this topic?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <!-- <h3>Methodology</h3> -->
                  <p>In search for answers to our questions we've decided to conduct <strong>qualitative research - in-depth interviews</strong>, which is a useful source of ideas and explanations.</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>function planning</li>
                    <li>function composing (after user testing)</li>
                    <li>prototype coordination</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Screener</h3>
                  <p>Considering where educational psychology is used, <strong>we looked for candidates among people involved in working with others and interested in psychology, pedagogy and teaching</strong>. To recruit proper respondents we prepared a screener in a form of survey in Google tool.</p>
                  
                  <p>We've shared our survey on facebook thematic groups for psychologists, teachers, pedagogists etc. and we were surprised how hesitant people were to take part in the research. Although at the bottom of the survey there was an information about privacy and who exactly will proccess gathered data, we often had to explain more as people asked a lot. So <strong>we've learned how important it is to put visibly, in introduction information about the company and research</strong>, of course without revealing too much of the topic.</p>

                  <h3>Mismatched choice of one respondent</h3>
                  <p>One of candidates did not quite fit the screener, but due to the fact that he works a lot with children and teenagers, we decided that it will be one, slightly different case, <strong>hoping we will broaden the horizons of our research</strong>. Ultimately, however, it turned out that we mismatched a lot and the recruited person hardly used the internet and trainings, and moreover, he was not interested in it due to the very small amount of free time. Therefore, in most cases it was not shown in the report. It was a lesson for us to <strong>always stick to the screener</strong>.</p>

                  <h3>Report</h3>
                  <p>The report we've prepared to sum up the research consisted of introduction to the subject, plan of research (methodology, recruitment of respondents, research objectives, research questions) plus analysis, conclussions recommendations divided into 5 topics:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Ways of learning</li>
                    <li>Using the Internet</li>
                    <li>Psychology and modern education</li>
                    <li>Courses, authorities, certificates</li>
                    <li>Games</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>and summary recommendations at the end of report.</p>

                  <h3></h3>
                  <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <!-- <p>To answer the question together with my team, our former student group of four, we've worked on a UX research for the new product. the topic under study is little known on the Polish market, so our biggest challenge was to define the potential audience in such a way as to look broadly and at the same time reach people who would actually be interested in the offered product.</p>

                  <p>We discussed the research objectives and research questions, prepared a screener and a research scenario. We conducted 10 interviews, analyzed them, drew conclusions and prepared recommendations. Everything was included in one detailed report.</p> -->
